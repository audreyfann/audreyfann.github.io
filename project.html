		<h1>Places That I've Been</h1>
		<p>	I really like to travel, and I have been to so many amazing places around the world. Here are a few of my favorite places I've been to.</h2>
		<h3>1. Macchu Picchu, Peru</h3>
		<img src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/science/photos/000/247/24713.ngsversion.1491231602188.adapt.1900.1.jpg" height="200px" width="400px">
		<p>	Hidden in Peru, Macchu Picchu was built in the 15th century and later abandoned. With houses built with huge stone blocks, how the walls are fused together without a mortar still remains a mystery today. Located high in the Andes Mountains, the elevation is 7,972 feet high. Some llamas also reside there. </p>
		<h3>2. Playa Del Carmen, Mexico</h3>

		<p>On the coast of Mexico, the water is shallow and warm. A great place to relax and calm down. In winter, the average temperature is about 80 degrees fahrenheit and in summer, it is about 90 degrees fahrenheit. Tons of places to visit nearby, like ancient Maya ruins. </p>
		<h3>3. Banff, Canada</h3>

		<p>	Located within the Banff national park, that place in Canada is a great place if you like the wilderness. Tons of trees, animals, and lakes, Banff has some amazing spots to visit including Bow Falls, and underground caves. Banff's lakes are really beautiful. </p>
		<h3>4. Alaska</h3>

		<p>	Like Canada, Alaska was really peaceful and really beautiiful. It is a great place to get brilliant pictures of whales. The glaciers are also a wonderful sight to see. Also, located in Alaska is Mount McKinley, America's highest peak. </p>
		<h3>5. Grand Canyon</h3>
		<img src="https://travel.usnews.com/static-travel/images/destinations/16/tuweep_getty.jpg" height="250" width="400">
		<p> The Grand Canyon was amazing to stand next to. All the layers could be seen and the canyon stretches on for a long time. There were a lot of people, but it was worth it.
