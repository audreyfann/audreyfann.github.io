		<p>I really want to see all the Ancient Buildings and the houses. I also want to see the volcanic islands and taste their food.
		<h3>2. South America</h3>

		<p>Since I've been to Peru and really liked it, I want to see more of South America. I would like to see the Amazon Rainforest and other cool animals or anicent buildings.</p>
		<h3>3. Italy</h3>

		<p>I like Italian food, and I would like to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa and more. If I go there, I will be sure to eat as much of their food as possible.</p>
		<h3>4. Japan</h3>

		<p>In the pictures, Japan seems really beautiful with all their cherry blossoms. I want to see their temples and the famous Mount Fuji.</p>
